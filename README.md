# README Giveme some Credit repository

## How to use this repo

You need to clone the repository, and set a auth.env file by duplicating the [auth-sample.env]('./../docker/auth-sample.env) file and set your own credits.

you then need to go in terminal in the docker file and launch the command:
`docker-compose up`. This will launch a Jupyter server.
After the build, you can copy/paste the url in terminal into your browser and access the Jupyter Notebooks.
